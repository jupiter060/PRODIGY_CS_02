Implementing image encryption and decryption through pixel manipulation involves modifying the pixel values of an image in a reversible manner. Firstly, grasp the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) representation of images where each pixel holds color information. To encrypt an image, devise an algorithm to transform the pixel values, concealing the original image data. Conversely, for decryption, develop an inverse algorithm to restore the original image from the encrypted version. Utilize Python libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV for image processing tasks. A typical workflow entails loading the image, applying encryption, saving the encrypted image, decrypting it, and finally saving the decrypted version. Remember to thoroughly test the encryption and decryption processes to ensure accuracy and reliability, and consider factors like key management and algorithm strength for robust security.
